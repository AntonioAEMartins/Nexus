# 📦 Nexus: WhatsApp Wrapper for Python

Welcome to **Nexus**, an open-source Python library designed to simplify integration with the WhatsApp Business Cloud API by Meta.

## 🚀 Project Goal

Our mission is to **empower developers** with an intuitive, well-documented wrapper that abstracts the complexities of Meta's Graph API, enabling quick and seamless integration of WhatsApp features into any project.

### 🎯 Why this project?

Many companies face friction during onboarding and integration due to Meta's complicated verification process and subpar documentation. This wrapper solves that by:

- Providing a clean, developer-friendly interface
- Offering an onboarding website that captures leads and explains account verification
- Focusing on **real developer experience (DX)** and speed
